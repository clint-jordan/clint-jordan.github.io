## RHCSA Study Guide

[RHEL 10 Docs](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/10)

Below is my collection of study notes for the Red Hat Certified System
Administrator exam. This isn't intended to be a comprehensive guide to Linux,
just a collection of sometimes vague notes, reference links, and some practice
lab exercises.

I took these notes while following along with Sander van Vugt's RHCSA course
that I purchased through [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/).
