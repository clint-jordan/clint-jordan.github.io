## The LeetCode [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/oizxjoit/)

I'm on the job hunt yet again, grinding away on LeetCode problems like a recent
graduate. This definitely isn't my top choice for topics to write about, but
with technical interviews looming overhead, it must be done.

I've been out of the game for a while actually working, but according to Reddit,
the Blind 75 is a popular list of technical interview prep problems.  I really
hope the job search ends before making it all the way through. If I complete the
list, or even go beyond to the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150), 
it's safe to assume that the job search is going poorly.

## LC-128 Longest Consecutive Sequence

### Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers, `nums`, return the length of the longest
consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

 

Constraints:

* 0 <= nums.length <= 105
* -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

### Solution

For this first installment of the series we'll start by writing a simple testing
function. You're often presented with list of test cases for these types of
problems, so it's helpful to have something you can quickly write up and
add problematic test cases to.

**Note:** This obviously won't be very useful if you're using the web-based LeetCode
editor.  This is essentially a much bare minimum version of their testing
apparatus.

        ([], 0),
        ]

  def test(self):
    for i, (inputs, expected) in enumerate(self.cases):
      result = self.longestConsecutive(inputs)
      status = "PASS" if result == expected else "FAIL"

          ni += 1
        longest = max(longest, ni-n)
    return longest
